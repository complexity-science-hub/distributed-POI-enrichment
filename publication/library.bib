abstract = {With the change in people's lifestyle and travel mode, understanding the individual and population mobility patterns in urban areas remains to an outstanding problem. Pervasive mobile communication technologies generate voluminous data related to human mobility, such as mobile phone data. To further study the characteristics of returning and exploration patterns of human movement in urban space, a multi-index model is proposed based on the original radius of the gyration index. In this paper, the classification mechanism of a single ratio of the radius of gyration for k-explorers and k-returners is illustrated. Some disadvantages of this mechanism are noted. A few indices of the model are proposed for deep mining of data on human mobility exploration and returning characteristics. Taking a mobile phone data during an entire month as a sample, and after data processing on the Spark platform, the characteristics of various indicators and their correlations are analyzed. The classification effects of different spatial indices for human exploration and returning are compared by using a support vector machine and the binary classification algorithm and are further compared with existing research results. The differences in the classification effects of these indicators are analyzed, which is helpful for in-depth studies of urban mobility patterns.},

abstract = {While customer segmentation for mobile services is typically based on demographics and reported use, smartphone measurement software enables to add directly observed user behavior. This explorative paper develops customer segmentation on relevant metrics from the perspective of network operators, handset manufacturers, and application developers. We analyze the results of a smartphone measurement project among 129 users using latent class analysis. The data are subsequently related to demographics and psychographics, to enable lifestyles. We find that several service clusters can be defined from the perspectives of the usage of the network (i.e. voice, SMS and data) and the usage of content services (i.e. URLs and applications). We demonstrate that such clusters can be related to demographic as well as psychographic segments. The results provide fine grained insights in market segments as well as new hypotheses about mobile behavior that are open for further testing. While being exploratory in nature, the study demonstrates the relevance of customer segmentation on smartphone measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rapid development in telecommunication networks is producing a huge amount of information regarding how people (with their mobile devices) move and behave over space and time. While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies. However, due to their noisy and temporally infrequent/irregular nature, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is particularly challenging. This paper provides an in-depth, systematic review of transport mode detection based on mobile phone network data. The results of the review show that existing studies tend to identify easy-to-detect modes (e.g., train or metro), or aggregate fine-grained modes into more general groups (e.g., public versus private transport). Rule-based methods making use of geographic data were often developed. More importantly, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of the proposed methods was seldom done and reported. Finally, we identify a list of research gaps currently being faced in this field, particularly regarding robust and real-time data cleaning and mode detection methods, “benchmark” datasets and metrics allowing the comparison of different mode detection methods, as well as privacy and bias issues.},

abstract = {Human mobility modeling for either transportation system development or individual location based services has a tan-gible impact on people's everyday experience. In recent years cell phone data has received a lot of attention as a promising data source because of the wide coverage, long observation period, and low cost. The challenge in utilizing such data is how to robustly extract people's trip sequences from sparse and noisy cell phone data and endow the extracted trips with semantic meaning, i.e., trip purposes. In this study we recon-struct trip sequences from sparse cell phone records. Next we propose a Bayesian trip purpose classification method and compare it to a Markov random field based trip purpose clus-tering method, representing scenarios with and without la-beled training data respectively. This procedure shows how the cell phone data, despite their coarse granularity and spar-sity, can be turned into a low cost, long term, and ubiquitous sensor network for mobility related services.},

abstract = {Airborne particulate matter (PM) may lead to increased cardiac risk through an inflammatory pathway. Therefore, we investigated associations between ambient PM and markers of systemic inflammation among repeated measures from 44 senior citizens ({\textgreater}/= 60 years of age) and examined susceptibility by conditions linked to chronic inflammation. Mixed models were used to identify associations between concentrations of fine PM [aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 2.5 microm (PM2.5)] averaged over 1-7 days and measures of C-reactive protein (CRP) , interleukin-6 (IL-6) , and white blood cells (WBCs) . Effect modification was investigated for diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and elevated mean inflammatory markers. We found positive associations between longer moving averages of PM2.5 and WBCs across all participants, with a 5.5{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) , 0.10 to 11{\%}] increase per interquartile increase (5.4 microg/m3) of PM2.5 averaged over the previous week. PM2.5 and CRP also exhibited positive associations among all individuals for averages longer than 1 day, with the largest associations for persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. For example, an interquartile increase in the 5-day mean PM)2.5 (6.1 microg/m3) was associated with a 14{\%} increase in CRP (95{\%} CI, -5.4 to 37{\%}) for all individuals and an 81{\%} (95{\%} CI, 21 to 172{\%}) increase for persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Persons with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension also exhibited positive associations between PM2.5 and IL-6. Individuals with elevated mean inflammatory markers exhibited enhanced associations with CRP, IL-6, and WBCs. We found modest positive associations between PM2.5 and indicators of systemic inflammation, with larger associations suggested for individuals with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and elevated mean inflammatory markers.},

abstract = {The user clients for accessing Internet are increasingly shifting from desktop computers to cellular devices. To be competitive in the rapidly changing market, operators, Internet service providers and application developers are required to have the capability of recognizing the models of cellular devices and understanding the traffic dynamics of cellular data network. In this paper, we propose a novel Jaccard measurement-based method to recognize cellular device models from network traffic data. This method is implemented as a scalable paralleled MapReduce program and achieves a high accuracy, 91.5{\%}, in the evaluation with 2.9 billion traffic records collected from the real network. Based on the recognition results, we conduct a comprehensive study of three characteristics of network traffic from device model perspec- tive, the network access time, the traffic volume, and the diurnal patterns. The analysis results show that the distribution of network access time can be modeled by a two-component Gaussian mixture model, and the distribution of traffic volumes is highly skewed and follows the power law. In addition, seven distinct diurnal patterns of cellular device usage are identified by applying unsupervised clustering algorithm on the collected massive traffic data.},

abstract = {Mobile phone metadata is increasingly used for humanitarian purposes in developing countries as traditional data is scarce. Basic demographic information is however often absent from mobile phone datasets, limiting the operational impact of the datasets. For these reasons, there has been a growing interest in predicting demographic information from mobile phone metadata. Previous work focused on creating increasingly advanced features to be modeled with standard machine learning algorithms. We here instead model the raw mobile phone metadata directly using deep learning, exploiting the temporal nature of the patterns in the data. From high-level assumptions we design a data representation and convolutional network architecture for modeling patterns within a week. We then examine three strategies for aggregating patterns across weeks and show that our method reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on both age and gender prediction using only the temporal modality in mobile metadata. We finally validate our method on low activity users and evaluate the modeling assumptions.},

@article{Bachir2019,
abstract = {Fast urbanization generates increasing amounts of travel flows, urging the need for efficient transport planning policies. In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.},

In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95{\%} of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

abstract = {Understanding customer mobility patterns to commercial districts is crucial for urban planning, facility management , and business strategies. Trade areas are a widely applied measure to quantify where the visitors are from. Traditional trade area analysis is limited to small-scale or store-level studies because information such as visits to competitor commercial entities and place of residence is collected by labour-intensive questionnaires or heavily biased location-based social media data. In this paper, we propose CellTradeMap, a novel district-level trade area analysis framework using mobile flow records (MFRs), a type of fine-grained cellular network data. CellTradeMap extracts robust location information from the irregularly sampled, noisy MFRs, adapts the generic trade area analysis framework to incorporate cellular data, and enhances the original trade area model with cellular-based features. We evaluate CellTradeMap on a large-scale cellular network dataset covering 3.5 million mobile phone users in a metropolis in China. Experimental results show that the trade areas extracted by CellTradeMap are aligned with domain knowledge and CellTradeMap can model trade areas with a high predictive accuracy.},

Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.},

abstract = {In construction of smart city, numerous vehicles' trajectory data are produced by Global Positioning System (GPS) to track their real time location. When these GPS data are processed by map matching, results can be used to support a large number of ITS applications such as real time road condition calculation, inspection of traffic event and emergency treatment. However, as the fast explosive growth of monitored vehicle number, massive GPS data proposes overwhelming challenges for map matching. Consequently, traditional map matching algorithms can hardly satisfy high demands for matching speed and accuracy. Therefore, a real time map matching algorithm for numerous GPS data is proposed to guarantee high matching accuracy and matching efficiency. Meanwhile, it can meet demands of GPS data processing required by the monitor of numerous vehicles within the city. Main contributions of the method are: (1) A Kalman filter based correcting algorithm is proposed to improve the matching accuracy of the traditional topological algorithm on the complicated road sections such as intersections and parallel roads. (2) Based on the Spark streaming framework, the serial map-matching algorithm is converted into a parallelized map-matching algorithm, which significantly improves the processing efficiency of the map matching. (3) A gridding method being applicable to the parallelized algorithm was proposed by the paper. The GPS data in the same grid were allocated to the same computing unit to improve the efficiency of the parallelized computation. Experimental results show that the matching accuracy of the algorithm demonstrated by the paper is increased by 10{\%}; the matching efficiency is 25{\%} higher than same amount of stand-alone computers. A cluster of 15 computers that operates the proposed algorithm is capable for the real time map matching for GPS data produced by 800 thousand vehicles, which can effectively and extensively support the lastingly increased demand for processing numerous GPS data. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late to be treated effectively as the cancer has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Symptoms of the early stages of the illness are often subtle and nonspecific. We identify searchers who issue credible, first-person diagnostic queries for pancreatic cancer and we learn models from prior search histories that predict which searchers will later input such queries. We show that we can infer the likelihood of seeing the rise of diagnostic queries months before they appear and characterize the tradeoff between predictivity and false positive rate. The findings highlight the potential of harnessing search logs for the early detection of pancreatic cancer and more generally for harnessing search systems to reduce health risks for individuals.},

To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to be implemented in real-world applications.},

abstract = {The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has provided rich data sources for analyzing, modeling, and interpreting human mobility patterns. This paper contributes to this research area by developing the Spatio-temporal Edit Distance measure, an extended algorithm to determine the similarity between user trajectories based on call detailed records (CDRs). We improve the traditional Edit Distance algorithm by incorporating both spatial and temporal information into the cost functions. The extended algorithm can preserve both space and time information from string-formatted CDR data. The novel method is applied to a large data set from Northeast China in order to test its effectiveness. Three types of analyses are presented for scenarios with and without the effect of time: (1) Edit Distance with spatial information; (2) Edit Distance with time as a factor in the cost function; and (3) Edit Distance with time as a constraint in partitioning trajectories. The outcomes of this research contribute to both methodological and empirical perspectives. The extended algorithm performs well for measuring low-resolution tracking information in CDRs, as well as facilitating the interpretation of user mobility patterns in the age of instant access.},

SpatialHadoop enriches the MapReduce layer by two new components, SpatialFileSplitter and SpatialRecordReader, for efficient and scalable spatial data processing. In the operations layer, SpatialHadoop is already equipped with a dozen of operations, including range query, kNN, and spatial join. Other spatial operations are also implemented following a similar approach.

In this work, we detect clusters of individuals by daily activity patterns, integrated with their usage of space and time, and show that daily routines can be highly predictable, with clear differences depending on the group, e.g. students vs. part time workers. This analysis presents the basis to capture collective activities at large scales and expand our perception of urban structure from the spatial dimension to spatial-temporal dimension.

GeoSpark consists of three layers: Apache Spark Layer, Spatial RDD Layer and Spatial Query Processing Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Spark functionalities that include loading / storing data to disk as well as regular RDD operations. Spatial RDD Layer consists of three novel Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) which extend regular Apache Spark RDDs to support geometrical and spatial objects. GeoSpark provides a geometrical operations library that accesses Spatial RDDs to perform basic geometrical operations (e.g., Overlap, Intersect). System users can leverage the newly defined SRDDs to effectively develop spatial data processing programs in Spark. The Spatial Query Processing Layer efficiently executes spatial query processing algorithms (e.g., Spatial Range, Join, KNN query) on SRDDs. GeoSpark also allows users to create a spatial index (e.g., R-tree, Quad-tree ) that boosts spatial data processing performance in each SRDD partition. Preliminary experiments show that GeoSpark achieves better run time performance than its Hadoop-based counterparts (e.g., SpatialHadoop).},

@phdthesis{Yin2018,
abstract = {Transportation has been one of the defining challenges of our age. Transportation decision makers are facing difficult questions in making informed decisions. Activity-based travel demand models are becoming essential tools used in transportation planning and regional development scenario evaluation. They describe travel itineraries of individual travelers, namely what activities they are participating in, when they perform these activities, and how they choose to travel to the activity locales. However, data collection for activity-based models is performed through travel surveys that are infrequent, expensive, and reflect changes in transportation with significant delays. Thanks to the ubiquitous cell phone data, we see an opportunity to substantially complement these surveys with data extracted from network carrier mobile phone usage logs, such as call detail records (CDRs). The large scale cellular data also opens up the opportunities for researchers to study urban mobility, population estimation, disaster response and social events, etc. However, most of the urban mobility models from cellular data focus on only one aspect of urban mobility (such as location, duration, or travel mode), or model several aspects separately. Moreover, most urban mobility studies ignore the activity types (trip purposes) since the information are not naturally available from the raw cellular traces. These trip purposes carry important information in activity-based travel demand modeling since many travel decisions depend on these activity types, such as travel mode and destination location. In this dissertation, we explore a framework that develops the state-of-the-art generative activity-based urban mobility models from raw cellular data, with the capability of inferring activity types for complementing activity-based travel demand modeling. To do so, we first present a method of extracting user stay locations from raw and noisy cellular data while not over-filtering short-term travel. Significant locations such as home and work places are inferred. Along this pre-processing pipeline, we also produce meaningful aggregated statistics about how people construct their daily lives and participate in activities. These statistics used to be available purely from traditional travel surveys, thus were updated very infrequently. With the processed yet unlabeled activity sequences, we improve the state-of-the-art generative activity-based urban mobility models step by step. First, we designed a method of collecting ground truth activities with the help from short range distributed antenna system (DAS), which has high spatial resolution. As a vanilla model, we first developed Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMMs) to infer travelers' activity patterns. The activity patterns include primary and secondary activities' spatial and temporal profiles and heterogeneous activity transitions depending on the context. To have a directed learning process, we explored several semi-supervised approaches, including self-training and co-training. The co-training model has both the generative power of IOHMM model and the discriminative nature of decision tree model. We apply the models to the data collected by a major network carrier serving millions of users in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our activity-based urban mobility model is experimentally validated with three independent data sources: aggregated statistics from travel surveys, a set of collected ground truth activities, and the results of a traffic micro-simulation informed with the travel plans synthesized from the developed generative model. As a classification task, we found that our full IOHMM outperforms partial IOHMM which outperforms standard HMM since IOHMM can incorporate more contextual information. We also found that co-training outperforms self-training, which outperforms the unsupervised IOHMM, thanks to the guidance of ground truth samples. This work is our first effort in exploring an end-to-end actionable solution to the practitioners in the form of modular and interpretable activity-based urban mobility models. One direct application of the urban mobility model is travel demand forecasting. Predictive models of urban mobility can help alleviate traffic congestion problems in future cities. State-of-the-art in travel demand forecasting is mainly concerned with long (months to years ahead) and very short term (seconds to minutes ahead) models. Long term forecasts aim at urban infrastructure planning, while short term predictions typically use high-resolution freeway detector/camera data to project traffic conditions in the near future. In this dissertation, we present a medium term (hours to days ahead) travel demand forecast system. Our approach is designed to use cellular data that are collected passively, continuously and in real time to predict the intended travel plans of anonymized and aggregated individual travelers. The traffic conditions derived through traffic simulation can overcome the data sparsity for short term prediction. The data resolution, prediction tolerance and accuracy for medium term travel demand forecast are compromises between long term forecast and short term prediction. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)},

abstract = {This review will summarize recent evidence on how outdoor air pollution may represent an underappreciated yet critical linkage between urbanization and the emergence of cardiometabolic diseases, with a focus on type 2 DM. We define cardiometabolic disease as the confluence of cardiovascular disease and type 2 DM in recognition of the fact that the milieu of diabetes fundamentally alters the pathophysiology of coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease. Thus, alteration in susceptibility to DM automatically increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. Indoor air pollution is not discussed owing to the paucity of data. It should be noted that our current understanding of air pollution–mediated cardiometabolic disease is derived from outdoor air pollution studies, with there being no good reasons to believe that the dose-response relationship to indoor air pollution will be any different. An understanding of potentially reversible environmental factors responsible for this rapid burgeoning of cardiometabolic disorders among developing nations is crucial in order to devise a societal response that is proportionate and adequate (2). In this review, the association between air pollution and type 2 DM is discussed unless this distinction cannot be made in the cited study (typically health registry data sets).},

The system uses the Localizing and Handling Network Event Systems (LocHNESs) platform developed by Telecom Italia for the real-time evaluation of urban dynamics based on the anonymous monitoring of mobile cellular networks. In addition, data are supplemented based on the instantaneous positioning of buses and taxis to provide information about urban mobility in real time, ranging from traffic conditions to the movements of pedestrians throughout the city. This system was exhibited at the Tenth International Architecture Exhibition of the Venice Biennale. Itmarks the unprecedentedmonitoring of a large urban area, which covered most of the city of Rome, in real time using a variety of sensing systems and will hopefully open the way to a new paradigm of understanding and optimizing urban dynamics.},

abstract = {Timings of human activities are marked by circadian clocks which in turn are entrained to different environmental signals. In an urban environment the presence of artificial lighting and various social cues tend to disrupt the natural entrainment with the sunlight. However, it is not completely understood to what extent this is the case. Here we exploit the large-scale data analysis techniques to study the mobile phone calling activity of people in large cities to infer the dynamics of urban daily rhythms. From the calling patterns of about 1,000,000 users spread over different cities but lying inside the same time-zone, we show that the onset and termination of the calling activity synchronizes with the east-west progression of the sun. We also find that the onset and termination of the calling activity of users follows a yearly dynamics, varying across seasons, and that its timings are entrained to solar midnight. Furthermore, we show that the average mid-sleep time of people living in urban areas depends on the age and gender of each cohort as a result of biological and social factors.},

abstract = {The use of large-scale machine learning and data mining methods is becoming ubiquitous in many application domains ranging from business intelligence and bioinformatics to self-driving cars. These methods heavily rely on matrix computations, and it is hence critical to make these computations scalable and efficient. These matrix computations are often complex and involve multiple steps that need to be optimized and sequenced properly for efficient execution. This paper presents new efficient and scalable matrix processing and optimization techniques for in-memory distributed clusters. The proposed techniques estimate the sparsity of intermediate matrix-computation results and optimize communication costs. An evaluation plan generator for complex matrix computations is introduced as well as a distributed plan optimizer that exploits dynamic cost-based analysis and rule-based heuristics to optimize the cost of matrix computations in an in-memory distributed environment. The result of a matrix operation will often serve as an input to another matrix operation, thus defining the matrix data dependencies within a matrix program. The matrix query plan generator produces query execution plans that minimize memory usage and communication overhead by partitioning the matrix based on the data dependencies in the execution plan. We implemented the proposed matrix processing and optimization techniques in Spark, a distributed in-memory computing platform. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our proposed techniques achieve up to an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over state-ofthe-Art distributed matrix computation systems on a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. To get a better understanding of people's mobility, cellular network signalling data including location information, is a promising large-scale data source. In order to estimate travel demand and infrastructure usage from the data, it is necessary to identify the trips users make. We present two trip extraction methods and compare their performance using a small dataset collected in Sweden. The trips extracted are compared with GPS tracks collected on the same mobiles. Despite the much lower location sampling rate in the cellular network signalling data, we are able to detect most of the trips found from GPS data. This is promising, given the relative simplicity of the algorithms. However, further investigation is necessary using a larger dataset and more types of algorithms. By applying the same methods to a second dataset for Senegal with much lower sampling rate than the Sweden dataset, we show that the choice of the trip extraction method tends to be even more important when the sampling rate is low.},

abstract = {Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second, we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.},

@article{Deville2014,
abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotem- poral distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estima- tions of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also dem- onstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applica- tions and a near real-time understanding of patterns and pro- cesses in human geography.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, measured with the US Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index (HEI), was associated with only a small reduction in major chronic disease risk. Research suggests that greater reductions in risk are possible with more specific guidance.$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether 2 alternate measures of diet quality, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Recommended Food Score (RFS), would predict chronic disease risk reduction more effectively than did the HEI.$\backslash$nDESIGN: A total of 38 615 men from the Health Professional's Follow-up Study and 67 271 women from the Nurses' Health Study completed dietary questionnaires. Major chronic disease was defined as the initial occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or nontraumatic death during 8-12 y of follow-up.$\backslash$nRESULTS: High AHEI scores were associated with significant reductions in risk of major chronic disease in men [multivariate relative risk (RR): 0.80; 95{\%} CI: 0.71, 0.91] and in women (RR: 0.89; 95{\%} CI: 0.82, 0.96) when comparing the highest and lowest quintiles. Reductions in risk were particularly strong for CVD in men (RR: 0.61; 95{\%} CI: 0.49, 0.75) and in women (RR: 0.72; 95{\%} CI: 0.60, 0.86). In men but not in women, the RFS predicted risk of major chronic disease (RR: 0.93; 95{\%} CI: 0.83, 1.04) and CVD (RR: 0.77; 95{\%} CI: 0.64, 0.93).$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The AHEI predicted chronic disease risk better than did the RFS (or the HEI, in our previous research) primarily because of a strong inverse association with CVD. Dietary guidelines can be improved by providing more specific and comprehensive advice.},

abstract = {Due to the ubiquitous use of spatial data applications and the large amounts of spatial data that these applications generate, the processing of large-scale distance joins in distributed systems is becoming increasingly popular. Two of the most studied distance join queries are the K Closest Pair Query (KCPQ) and the $\epsilon$ Distance Join Query ($\epsilon$ DJQ). The KCPQ finds the K closest pairs of points from two datasets and the $\epsilon$ DJQ finds all the possible pairs of points from two datasets, that are within a distance threshold $\epsilon$ of each other. Distributed cluster-based computing systems can be classified in Hadoop-based and Spark-based systems. Based on this classification, in this paper, we compare two of the most current and leading distributed spatial data management systems, namely SpatialHadoop and LocationSpark, by evaluating the performance of existing and newly proposed parallel and distributed distance join query algorithms in different situations with big real-world datasets. As a general conclusion, while SpatialHadoop is more mature and robust system, LocationSpark is the winner with respect to the total execution time.},

abstract = {This paper aims to develop a new approach for the estimation of dynamic origin–destination (O–D) flow using cell phones as traffic probes. The state-space model, which depends on the autoregressive dynamics of O–D flow and the time series for link volume counts, was adopted. Unlike a direct approach that uses sample O–D flows extracted from the cell-based location data as additional observations, an indirect approach is proposed wherein the assignment map in the model is derived from the passing time at observation locations and the path choice pro- portion. A probe phone's passing time at a certain point in a cell was approximated with its entry and exit times at cell boundaries. The average path choice proportion was also estimated using cell- based trajectories of probe phones. The simulation experiments confirmed that the approach was successfully applicable to the real-world freeway network. The results suggest that the O–D flows estimated from the present approach are promising in that the mean absolute error ratio was smaller than the case wherein only historical O–D flows are concerned. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the present approach met the requirements for an urban area encompassing a huge number of cell phone users in a microcell system. Index},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis: It has been suggested that air pollution may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes but data on particulate matter with diameter {\textless}2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) are inconsistent. We examined the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and diabetes incidence. Methods: We used the Danish Nurse Cohort with 28,731 female nurses who at recruitment in 1993 or 1999 reported information on diabetes prevalence and risk factors, and obtained data on incidence of diabetes from National Diabetes Register until 2013. We estimated annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, particulate matter with diameter {\textless}10 $\mu$m (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at their residence since 1990 using a dispersion model and examined the association between the 5-year running mean of pollutants and diabetes incidence using a time-varying Cox regression. Results: Of 24,174 nurses 1137 (4.7{\%}) developed diabetes. We detected a significant positive association between PM2.5 and diabetes incidence (hazard ratio; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.11; 1.02-1.22 per interquartile range of 3.1 $\mu$g/m3), and weaker associations for PM10 (1.06; 0.98-1.14 per 2.8 $\mu$g/m3), NO2 (1.05; 0.99-1.12 per 7.5 $\mu$g/m3), and NOx (1.01; 0.98-1.05 per 10.2 $\mu$g/m3) in fully adjusted models. Associations with PM2.5 persisted in two-pollutant models. Associations with PM2.5 were significantly enhanced in never smokers (1.24; 1.09-1.42), and augmented in obese (1.25; 1.06-1.47) and subjects with myocardial infarction (1.32; 0.86-2.02), but without significant interaction. Conclusions/interpretation: Fine particulate matter may the most relevant pollutant for diabetes development among women, and non-smokers, obese women, and heart disease patients may be most susceptible.},

Because of the high coverage rate of these phones, the data can be used as an addition to or even as a replacement for stationary sensors when the deployment of stationary sensors is not possible or too expen- sive. However, cell phone signaling data are error-prone and have to be preprocessed for use in traffic modeling. First, the positions reported by cell phone signaling data may be inaccurate. Second, because of privacy issues, additional data may be introduced to obfuscate actual movements. This study presents three filters to rectify the trajectories generated by cell phone movements. For evaluation, the filters were applied to cell phone trajectories and compared with corresponding GPS-based tracks. The evaluation data covered 4,933 tracks collected automatically and 5 tracks collected manually. The proposed filters significantly improved estimation of speed and position compared with the raw trajectories of cell phone movements. Currently},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Air pollution is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Many of the biological pathways involved could also promote diabetes mellitus (DM). We therefore investigated the association between DM prevalence and exposure to traffic-related air pollution (nitrogen dioxide [NO 2]). METHODS: Study participants were patients who attended two respiratory clinics in Hamilton (n = 5228) and Toronto (n = 2406). The diagnosis of DM was ascertained by linkage to administrative databases of the Ontario universal Health Insurance Plan for patients aged 40 years and above. Geographic Information systems methodology was used to assign individual estimates of NO2 based on a network of samplers in each city. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relations between NO2 exposures and the odds of DM diagnosis. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, body mass index, and neighborhood income there were positive effects in women on the odds ratio for DM for each 1 ppb NO2 exposure in Toronto (OR 1.055, 95{\%} CI: 0.99 to 1.11) and Hamilton (OR 1.029, 95{\%} CI: 0.98 to 1.08). In a meta-analytic model including both cities, there was a significant effect in women (OR = 1.04; 95{\%} CI: 1.00 to 1.08). Across the inter-quartile range (approximately 4 ppb NO2) there was nearly a 17{\%} increase in the odds of DM for women. There were no positive associations among men. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to NO2, a marker of traffic-related air pollutants, was associated with DM prevalence among women. Exposure estimate errors in men may explain the apparent gender difference. These results suggest that common air pollutants are associated with DM and warrant more investigation to determine if this is a cause-and-effect relationship.},

Today, nearly all security analytics systems suffer from a lack of even basic data protections. An adversary can eavesdrop on SAS outputs and advanced malware can undetectably suppress or tamper with SAS messages to conceal attacks. We introduce PillarBox, a tool that enforces integrity for SAS data even when such data is buffered on a compromised host within an adversarially controlled network. Additionally, PillarBox (optionally) offers stealth, concealing SAS data and potentially even alerting rules on a compromised host. Using data from a large enterprise and on-host performance measurements, we show experimentally that PillarBox has minimal overhead and is practical for real-world systems.},

abstract = {High-resolution individual geolocation data passively collected from mobile phones is increasingly sold in private markets and shared with researchers. This data poses significant security, privacy, and ethical risks: it's been shown that users can be re-identified in such datasets, and its collection rarely involves their full consent or knowledge. This data is valuable to private firms (e.g. targeted marketing) but also presents clear value as a public good. Recent public interest research has demonstrated that high-resolution location data can more accurately measure segregation in cities and provide inexpensive transit modeling. But as data is aggregated to mitigate its re-identifiability risk, its value as a good diminishes. How do we rectify the clear security and safety risks of this data, its high market value, and its potential as a resource for public good? We extend the recently proposed concept of a tradeoff curve that illustrates the relationship between dataset utility and privacy. We then hypothesize how this tradeoff differs between private market use and its potential use for public good. We further provide real-world examples of how high resolution location data, aggregated to varying degrees of privacy protection, can be used in the public sphere and how it is currently used by private firms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that longer-term exposure to air pollutants over years confers higher risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than shorter-term exposure. One explanation is that the cumulative adverse effects that develop over longer durations lead to the genesis of chronic disease. Preliminary epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for incident hypertension and diabetes mellitus associated with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and nitrogen oxides in a cohort of black women living in Los Angeles. Pollutant levels were estimated at participants' residential addresses with land use regression models (nitrogen oxides) and interpolation from monitoring station measurements (PM(2.5)). Over follow-up from 1995 to 2005, 531 incident cases of hypertension and 183 incident cases of diabetes mellitus occurred. When pollutants were analyzed separately, the IRR for hypertension for a 10-$\mu$g/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) was 1.48 (95{\%} CI, 0.95-2.31), and the IRR for the interquartile range (12.4 parts per billion) of nitrogen oxides was 1.14 (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.25). The corresponding IRRs for diabetes mellitus were 1.63 (95{\%} CI, 0.78-3.44) and 1.25 (95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.46). When both pollutants were included in the same model, the IRRs for PM(2.5) were attenuated and the IRRs for nitrogen oxides were essentially unchanged for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure to air pollutants, especially traffic-related pollutants, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and possibly of hypertension.},

abstract = {Finding trajectories and discovering motifs that are similar in large datasets is a central problem for a wide range of applications. Solutions addressing this problem usually rely on spatial indexing and on the computation of a similarity measure in polynomial time. Although effective in the context of sparse trajectory datasets, this approach is too expensive in the context of dense datasets, where many trajectories potentially match with a given query. In this paper, we apply fingerprinting, a copy-detection mechanism used in the context of textual data, to trajectories. To this end, we fingerprint trajectories with geodabs, a construction based on geohash aimed at trajectory fingerprinting. We demonstrate that by relying on the properties of a space filling curve geodabs can be used to build sharded inverted indexes. We show how normalization affects precision and recall, two key measures in information retrieval. We then demonstrate that the probabilistic nature of fingerprinting has a marginal effect on the quality of the results. Finally, we evaluate our method in terms of performances and show that, in contrast with existing methods, it is not affected by the density of the trajectory dataset and that it can be efficiently distributed.},

Apart from personal factors its incidence might be influenced by environmental risks such as air pollution and noise. This paper reports a systematic review and meta-analysis on the risk for type 2 diabetes due to long-term noise exposure. Electronic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Internet yielded 9 relevant studies (5 for residential and 4 for occupational exposure). They were checked against a predefined list of safeguards against bias producing individual quality scores, which were then fed to MetaXL to conduct a quality effects meta-analysis. People exposed at their homes to roughly L(den) {\textgreater} 60 dB had 22{\%} higher risk (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.37) for type 2 diabetes in comparison to those exposed to L(den) {\textless} 64 dB; when studies reporting contentious exposure categories were excluded, there was still 19{\%} risk (95{\%} CI: 1.05-1.35) for L(den) = 60-70 dB versus L(den) {\textless} 60 dB. In occupational environment there was not significant risk (relative risk [RR] = 0.91, 95{\%} CI: 0.78-1.06) for {\textless} 85 dB versus {\textgreater}85 dB. There was no heterogeneity in the two groups (I² = 0.00). The results should be interpreted with caution due to methodological discrepancies across the studies; however, they are indicative of the close links that noise pollution might have not only to cardiovascular diseases but to endocrine dysfunction as well.},

We present the Simba (Spatial In-Memory Big data Analytics) system that offers scalable and efficient in-memory spatial query processing and analytics for big spatial data. Simba is based on Spark and runs over a cluster of commodity machines. In particular, Simba extends the Spark SQL engine to support rich spatial queries and analytics through both SQL and the DataFrame API. It introduces indexes over RDDs in order to work with big spatial data and complex spatial operations. Lastly, Simba implements an effective query optimizer, which leverages its indexes and novel spatial-aware optimizations, to achieve both low latency and high throughput. Extensive experiments over large data sets demonstrate Simba's superior performance compared against other spatial analytics system.},

Understanding the distribution and progression of chronic diseases of a population is important in assisting the allocation of medical resources as well as the design of policies in preemptive healthcare. Traditional methods to obtain large scale indicators on population health, e.g., surveys and statistical analysis, can be costly and time-consuming and often lead to a coarse spatio-temporal picture. In this paper, we leverage a dataset describing the human mobility patterns of citizens in a large metropolitan area. By viewing local human lifestyles we predict the evolution rate of several chronic diseases at the level of a city neighborhood. We apply the combination of a col-laborative topic modeling (CTM) and a Gaussian mixture method (GMM) to tackle the data spar-sity challenge and achieve robust predictions on health conditions simultaneously. Our method enables the analysis and prediction of disease rate evolution at fine spatio-temporal scales and demonstrates the potential of incorporating datasets from mobile web sources to improve population health monitoring. Evaluations using real-world check-in and chronic disease morbidity datasets in the city of London show that the proposed CTM+GMM model outperforms various baseline methods.},

abstract = {Background: Population studies suggest that persons with diabetes are more sensitive to the effects of particulate matter (PM) air pollution. However, the biological mechanisms of a possible prothrombotic effect underlying this enhanced susceptibility remain largely unknown. Objective: We hypothesized that exposure to PM causes prothrombotic changes in persons with diabetes, possibly via systemic inflammation. Methods: Our study included 137 nonsmoking adults with diabetes who were outpatients at the University Hospital Leuven. Recent exposure (2 hr before examination) to ambient PM was measured at the entrance of the hospital. Individual chronic exposure to PM was assessed by measuring the area occupied by carbon in airway macrophages obtained by sputum induction. Platelet function was measured ex vivo with the PFA-100 platelet function analyzer, which simulates a damaged blood vessel; we analyzed the function of platelets in primary hemostasis under high shear conditions. Total and differential blood leukocytes were counted. Results: Independent of antiplatelet medication, an interquartile range (IQR) increase of 39.2 $\mu$g/m3 in PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 $\mu$m) concentration measured 2 hr before the clinical examination (recent exposure) was associated with a decrease of 21.1 sec [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), − 35.3 to − 6.8] in the PFA-100 closure time (i.e., increased platelet activation) and an increase in blood leukocytes of 512 per microliter of blood (95{\%} CI, 45.2–979). Each area increase of 0.25 $\mu$m2 (IQR) in carbon load of airway macrophages (chronic exposure) was associated with an increase of 687 leukocytes per microliter of blood (95{\%} CI, 224–1,150). Conclusions: A relevant increase in recent PM exposure was associated with a change in platelet function toward a greater prothrombotic tendency. The magnitude of the change was about two-thirds (in the opposite direction) of the average effect of antiplatelet medication. Diabetic patients showed evidence of proinflammatory response to both recent and chronic exposure to PM air pollution.},

RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

abstract = {We compiled a demo application and collected a motion database of more than 10,000 smartphone users to produce a health risk model trained on physical activity streams. We turned to adversarial domain adaptation and employed the UK Biobank dataset of motion data, augmented by a rich set of clinical information as the source domain to train the model using a deep residual convolutional neuron network (ResNet). The model risk score is a biomarker of ageing, since it was predictive of lifespan and healthspan (as defined by the onset of specified diseases), and was elevated in groups associated with life-shortening lifestyles, such as smoking. We ascertained the target domain performance in a smaller cohort of the mobile application that included users who were willing to share answers to a short questionnaire related to their disease and smoking status. We thus conclude that the proposed pipeline combining deep convolutional and Domain Adversarial neuron networks (DANN) is a powerful tool for disease risk and lifestyle-associated hazard assessment from mobile motion sensors that are transferable across devices and populations.},

abstract = {This paper aims at estimating the current location, or predicting the next location, of a person when the recent location sequence of that person is unknown. Inspired by the fact that the behavior of an individual is greatly related to other people, a two-phase framework is proposed, which first finds persons who have highly correlated movements with a person-of-interest, then estimates the person's location based on the position information for selected persons. For the first phase, we propose two methods: community interaction similarity-based (CISB) and behavioral similarity-based (BSB). The CISB method finds persons who have similar encounters with other members in the entire community. In the BSB method, members are selected if they show similar behavioral patterns with a given person, even though there are no direct encounters or evident co-locations between them. For the second phase, a neural network is considered in order to develop the prediction model based on the selected members. Evaluation results show that the proposed prediction model under the BSB scheme outperforms other methods, achieving top-1 accuracy of 71.13{\%} and 69.36{\%} for estimations of current and next locations, respectively, with the MIT dataset and 92.31{\%} and 92.03{\%} in case of the Dartmouth dataset.},

abstract = {Present day smartphones like iPhone and Andriod based phones have lead to explosive growth in traffic over cellular networks. The growth has occurred both in volume and diversity in terms of traffic characteristics. Among the different types of traffic, there is prominent increase in background type of data due to popularity of applications like Facebook, Skype, Email clients etc which keeps exchanging data with corresponding server, even when the user is not actively using the application. In order to save power consumption of smart phones and for optimal allocation of resources to deserving phones in network by minimumpossible signaling traffic, 3GPP LTE specifications have defined mechanisms like connected mode DRX (Discontinuous Reception) which offers two stage of sleep in form of long {\&} short DRX. Since such diverse type of applications are running in smartphone, this work attempts to investigate traffic character- istics of popular applications in Andriod based smartphones. Due to various reasons, such applications, keep consuming precious bandwidth and battery even when not in active use. Main emphasis is thus provided to study the characteristic of these applications when they are running without user intervention. Since, the diverse range of data characteristics is assumed to be causing drain in User Equipment (UE) battery and overhead in NW signaling, we expect that this investigation would help in developing appropriate new power saving mechanisms in future releases of cellular networks.},

abstract = {The proliferation of indoor and outdoor tracking devices has led to a vast amount of spatial data. Each object can be described by several trajectories that, once analysed, can yield to significant knowledge. In particular, pattern analysis by clustering generic trajectories can give insight into objects sharing the same patterns. Still, sequential clustering approaches fail to handle large volumes of data. Hence, the necessity of distributed systems to be able to infer knowledge in a trivial time interval. In this paper, we detail an efficient, scalable and distributed execution pipeline for clustering raw trajectories. The clustering is achieved via a fuzzy similarity relation obtained by the transitive closure of a proximity relation. Moreover, the pipeline is integrated in Spark, implemented in Scala and leverages the Core and Graphx libraries making use of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) and graph processing. Furthermore, a new simple, but very efficient, partitioning logic has been deployed in Spark and integrated into the execution process. The objective behind this logic is to equally distribute the load among all executors by considering the complexity of the data. In particular, resolving the load balancing issue has reduced the conventional execution time in an important manner. Evaluation and performance of the whole distributed process has been analysed by handling the Geolife project's GPS trajectory dataset.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting, and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited thanks to the lack of tools to monitor the time resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six month period. We find that in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time independent characteristic length scale and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent based modeling.},

abstract = {Tourist flows in historical cities are continuously growing in a globalized world and adequate governance processes, politics and tools are necessary in order to reduce impacts on the urban livability and to guarantee the preservation of cultural heritage. The ICTs offer the possibility of collecting large amount of data that can point out and quantify some statistical and dynamic properties of human mobility emerging from the individual behavior and referring to a whole road network. In this paper we analyze a new dataset that has been collected by the Italian mobile phone company TIM, which contains the GPS positions of a relevant sample of mobile devices when they actively connected to the cell phone network. Our aim is to propose innovative tools allowing to study properties of pedestrian mobility on the whole road network. Venice is a paradigmatic example for the impact of tourist flows on the resident life quality and on the preservation of cultural heritage. The GPS data provide anonymized georeferenced information on the displacements of the devices. After a filtering procedure, we develop specific algorithms able to reconstruct the daily mobility paths on the whole Venice road network. The statistical analysis of the mobility paths suggests the existence of a travel time budget for the mobility and points out the role of the rest times in the empirical relation between the mobility time and the corresponding path length. We succeed to highlight two connected mobility subnetworks extracted from the whole road network, that are able to explain the majority of the observed mobility. Our approach shows the existence of characteristic mobility paths in Venice for the tourists and for the residents. Moreover the data analysis highlights the different mobility features of the considered case studies and it allows to detect the mobility paths associated to different points of interest. Finally we have disaggregated the Italian and foreigner categories to study their different mobility behaviors.},

abstract = {Home-work commuting has always attracted significant research attention because of its impact on human mobility. One of the key assumptions in this domain of study is the universal uniformity of commute times. However, a true comparison of commute patterns has often been hindered by the intrinsic differences in data collection methods, which make observation from different countries potentially biased and unreliable. In the present work, we approach this problem through the use of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs), which offers a consistent method for investigating mobility patterns in wholly different parts of the world. We apply our analysis to a broad range of datasets, at both the country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Saudi Arabia), and city (Boston) scale. Additionally, we compare these results with those obtained from vehicle GPS traces in Milan. While different regions have some unique commute time characteristics, we show that the home-work time distributions and average values within a single region are indeed largely independent of commute distance or country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Boston)-despite substantial spatial and infrastructural differences. Furthermore, our comparative analysis demonstrates that such distance-independence holds true only if we consider multimodal commute behaviors-as consistent with previous studies. In car-only (Milan GPS traces) and car-heavy (Saudi Arabia) commute datasets, we see that commute time is indeed influenced by commute distance. Finally, we put forth a testable hypothesis and suggest ways for future work to make more accurate and generalizable statements about human commute behaviors.},

abstract = {Recent studies on mobility modeling have focused on characterizing user mobility from real traces of wireless LANs (WLANs) and creating mobility models based on such characterization. However, most of the work does not study how user mobility is correlated in time at different time scales. For example, the future APs with which a user will be associated are predicted without the knowledge of when the association will take place and for how long. In this paper, we build a mathematical model for characterizing both steady-state and transient behaviors of user mobility in WLANs. Specifically, we model user mobility by a semi-Markov process, and obtain the transition probability matrix and the sojourn time distribution from the association history of WLAN users available at Dartmouth college [21]. With the steady-state characterization of user mobility in WLANs, we can estimate the long-term wireless network usage among different access points. By comparing the steady-state distributions of semi-Markov models built based on trace data collected at different time scales, we are able to characterize the degree of correlation in time and location. We also perform a transient behavior analysis of the semi-Markov process (that characterizes user mobility), and devise a timed location prediction algorithm that accurately predicts the future locations of users — both the future access points they will associate themselves with and the association duration. We demonstrate the utility of timed location prediction, by showing how it can be utilized to predict the distribution of future user locations with the time information figured in, and redistributing loads among neighboring APs. An improvement of 80{\%} (in terms of load balance) is observed in a wide spectrum of traffic loads in the simulation.},

abstract = {Aims: Diabetes is often diagnosed late. This study aimed to assess the possibility for earlier detection of diabetes from search data, using predictive models trained on large-scale data. Methods: We extracted all English-language queries made by people in the USA to Bing during 1 year and identified queries containing symptoms of diabetes. We compared the ability of four different prediction models (linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree and random forest) to distinguish between users who stated that they were diagnosed with diabetes and users who did not refer to diabetes or diabetes drugs but queried about at least one of the symptoms. Results: We identified 11,050 “new diabetes users” who stated they had been diagnosed with diabetes and approximately 11.5 million “control users” who queried about symptoms without querying for terms related to diabetes. Both the logistic regression and the random forest models were able to distinguish between the populations with an area under curve of 0.92 which translates to a positive predictive value of 56{\%} at a false-positive rate of 1{\%}. The model could identify patients up to 240 days before they mentioned being diagnosed. Conclusions: Some undiagnosed diabetes patients can be detected accurately according to their symptom queries to a search engine. Such earlier diagnosis, especially in cases of type 1 diabetes, could be clinically meaningful. The ability of search engines to serve as a population-wide screening tool could potentially be improved using additional data provided by users.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. Research on moving objects and analysis of movement patterns in urban networks can help us evaluate urban land-use types. With the help of technologies such as global positioning systems, spatial information systems and spatial data the study of movement patterns is possible. By understanding and quantifying the patterns of pedestrian trajectories, we can find effects of and relations between urban land-use types and movements of pedestrians. Understanding urban land-use and their relationships with human activities has great implications for smart and sustainable urban development. In this study, we use the data of various urban land-use types and the trajectory of pedestrians in an urban environment. This paper presents a new approach for identifying busy urban land-use by semantic spatial trajectory in which urban land-uses are assessed according to the pedestrian trajectories. Undoubtedly, the extraction of popular urban land-uses and analysis of the association between popular places and the spatial and semantic movement allow us to improve the urban structure and city marketing system. In this regard, for semantic analysis of urban land-use, all stop points are extracted by a time threshold and they are enriched according to semantic information such as age, occupation, and gender. We examine if and how habits of using land-use types depend on qualities such as age, gender and occupation. For analysis of effects of various urban land-use types, all stop points near each urban land-use are detected. Determining what type of urban land-use cause pedestrian traffic and high absorption coefficient and what relation such high traffic has with semantic information such as age, occupation and gender. By clustering the stop points, the results indicate that stop at urban networks for each gender have a spatial correlation. Also, the results show that some urban land-use types have high traffic and we have a correlation with some semantic information such as age, gender and occupation.},

Therefore, to analyze user's routing preference, identifying routes they actually choose is a crucial task. Cellular network data contains sufficient spatio-temporal information, which is widely used for trajectory analysis nowadays. However, it is a big challenge to extract precise trajectory from the cellular network data due to its low positioning accuracy. Compared to Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm, we present a Spatio-Temporal Density Clustering algorithm considering the timing sequence of the points to promote the precision of the trajectories, which aims to filter users' most probable routes with the map matching algorithm. Our approach could find out those most probable routes and the probability of each route. Finally, we experimented with real data. The results show that our approach is efficient for both extracting the probable trajectories and identifying multi-routes that users would prefer to route.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Road traffic noise at normal urban levels can lead to stress and sleep disturbances. Both excess of stress hormones and reduction in sleep quality and duration may lead to higher risk for type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether long-term exposure to residential road traffic noise is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. METHODS: In the population-based Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort of 57,053 people 50-64 years of age at enrollment in 1993-1997, we identified 3,869 cases of incident diabetes in a national diabetes registry between enrollment and 2006. The mean follow-up time was 9.6 years. Present and historical residential addresses from 1988 through 2006 were identified using a national register, and exposure to road traffic noise was estimated for all addresses. Associations between exposure to road traffic noise and incident diabetes were analyzed in a Cox regression model. RESULTS: A 10-dB higher level of average road traffic noise at diagnosis and during the 5 years preceding diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes, with incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 1.08 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.14) and 1.11 (95{\%} CI: 1.05, 1.18), respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders including age, body mass index, waist circumference, education, air pollution (nitrogen oxides), and lifestyle characteristics. After applying a stricter definition of diabetes (2,752 cases), we found IRRs of 1.11 (95{\%} CI: 1.03, 1.19) and 1.14 (95{\%} CI: 1.06, 1.22) per 10-dB increase in road traffic noise at diagnosis and during the 5 years preceding diagnosis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Exposure to residential road traffic noise was associated with a higher risk of diabetes. This study provides further evidence that urban noise may adversely influence population health.},

abstract = {Background Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes aff ecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identifi cation and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool fi rst developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings We generated 9{\textperiodcentered}3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17{\textperiodcentered}2 billion, 95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 15{\textperiodcentered}4-19{\textperiodcentered}2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2{\textperiodcentered}39 billion, 2{\textperiodcentered}30-2{\textperiodcentered}50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each aff ected more than 10{\%} of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-defi ciency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that aff ected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2{\textperiodcentered}36 billion (2{\textperiodcentered}35-2{\textperiodcentered}37 billion) individuals aff ected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals aff ected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20-30{\%} of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional defi ciencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-defi ciency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profi le driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.},

abstract = {Background: Recent studies suggest that persons with diabetes and with cardiovascular disease may be at higher risk for the short-term effects of air pollution. We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. Methods and results: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). Conclusions: These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The availability of massive digital traces of human whereabouts has offered a series of novel insights on the quantitative patterns characterizing human mobility. In particular, numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions.},

abstract = {Boredom is a common human emotion which may lead to an active search for stimulation. People often turn to their mobile phones to seek that stimulation. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of automatically inferring boredom from mobile phone usage. In a two-week in-the-wild study, we collected over 40,000,000 usage logs and 4398 boredom self-reports of 54 mobile phone users. We show that a user-independent machine-learning model of boredom –leveraging features related to recency of communication, usage intensity, time of day, and demographics– can infer boredom with an accuracy (AUCROC) of up to 82.9{\%}. Results from a second field study with 16 participants suggest that people are more likely to engage with recommended content when they are bored, as inferred by our boredom-detection model. These findings enable boredom-triggered proactive recommender systems that attune their users' level of attention and need for stimulation.},

We describe a methodology to measure IPv6 adoption from the perspective of a Web site operator and to evaluate the impact that adding IPv6 to a Web site will have on its users. We apply our methodology to the Google Web site and present results collected over the last year. Our data show that IPv6 adoption, while growing significantly, is still low, varies considerably by country, and is heavily influenced by a small number of large deployments. We find that native IPv6 latency is comparable to IPv4 and provide statistics on IPv6 transition mechanisms used.},

abstract = {Purpose of ReviewDiabetes mellitus is a top contributor to the global burden of mortality and disability in adults. There has also been a slow but steady rise in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in youth. The current review summarizes recent findings regarding the impact of increased exposure to air pollutants on the type 2 diabetes epidemic.Recent FindingsHuman and animal studies provide strong evidence that exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important role in metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes etiology. This work is supported by recent findings that have observed similar effect sizes for increased exposure to air pollutants on clinical measures of risk for type 2 diabetes in children and adults. Further, studies indicate that these effects may be more pronounced among individuals with existing risk factors, including obesity and prediabetes.SummaryCurrent epidemiological evidence suggests that increased air pollution exposure contributes to alterations in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and beta ($\beta$)-cell function. Future work is needed to identify the specific detrimental pollutants that alter glucose metabolism. Additionally, advanced tools and new areas of investigation present unique opportunities to study the underlying mechanisms, including intermediate pathways, that link increased air pollution exposure with type 2 diabetes onset.},

abstract = {Smartphone users are increasingly shifting to using apps as "gateways" to Internet services rather than traditional web browsers. App marketplaces for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms have made it attractive for developers to deploy apps and easy for users to discover and start using many network-enabled apps quickly. For example, it was recently reported that the iOS AppStore has more than 350K apps and more than 10 billion downloads. Furthermore, the appearance of tablets and mobile devices with other form factors, which also use these marketplaces, has increased the diversity in apps and their user population. Despite the increasing importance of apps as gateways to network services, we have a much sparser understanding of how, where, and when they are used compared to traditional web services, particularly at scale. This paper takes a first step in addressing this knowledge gap by presenting results on app usage at a national level using anonymized network measurements from a tier-1 cellular carrier in the U.S. We identify traffic from distinct marketplace apps based on HTTP signatures and present aggregate results on their spatial and temporal prevalence, locality, and correlation.},

abstract = {Urban mobility is known to have a relevant impact on work related car accidents especially during commuting. It is characterized by highly dynamic spatial–temporal variability. There are open questions about the size of this phenomenon; its spatial, temporal, and demographic characteristics; and driving mechanisms. A case study is here presented for the city of Rome, Italy. High-resolution population presence and demographic data, derived from mobile phone traffic, were used. Hourly profiles of a defined mobility factor (NPM) were calculated for a gridded domain during working days and cluster analyzed to obtain mean diurnal NPM mobility patterns. Age distributions of the population were calculated from demographic data to get insight in the type of population involved in mobility, and spatially linked with the mobility patterns. Census data about production units and their employees were related with the classified NPM mobility patterns. Seven different NPM mobility patterns were identified and mapped over the study area. The mobility slightly deviates from the census-based demography (0.15 on average, in a range of 0 to 1). The number of employees per 100 inhabitants was found to be the main driving mechanism of mobility. Finally, contributions of people employed in different economic macrocategories were assigned to each mobility time-pattern. Results provide a deeper knowledge of urban dynamics and their driving mechanisms in Rome.},

abstract = {We present new spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and interpolation capabilities of the R package gstat. Various spatio-temporal covariance models have been implemented, such as the separable, product-sum, metric and sum-metric models. In a real-world application we compare spatio-temporal interpolations using these models with a purely spatial kriging approach. The target variable of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using gstat. We conclude that the system works properly and that the extension of gstat facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and prediction for R users.},

abstract = {Travel behaviour has been studied for decades to guide transportation development and management, with the support of traditional data collected by travel surveys. Recently, with the development of information and communication technologies (ICT), we have entered an era of big data, and many sources of novel data, including mobile phone data, have emerged and been applied to travel behaviour research. Compared with traditional travel data, mobile phone data have many unique features and advantages, which attract scholars in various fields to apply them to travel behaviour research, and a certain amount of progress has been made to date. However, this is only the beginning, and mobile phone data still have great potential that needs to be exploited to further advance human mobility studies. This paper provides a review of existing travel behaviour studies that have applied mobile phone data, and presents the progress that has been achieved to date, and then discusses the potential of mobile phone data in advancing travel behaviour research and raises some challenges that need to be dealt with in this process.},
